        <h2>Brittanie Morgan</h2>
        <p>I am a second-year student at the University of the West Indies and my major is Software Engineering.
            Although I currently live in Kingston for school, I was raised in the beautiful parish of Hanover. In my spare
            time, I enjoy learning Spanish, baking and watching sci-fi movies. I'm interested in web development because
            I want to learn more about the many steps taken to have an active webpage on the internet. I also like the
            creative freedom that comes with web development. This year I'm taking Web Development I to help with my
            decision on what I wish to do after university. Presently, I am interested in working as a Mobile App
            Developer or an AI Researcher when I graduate.
